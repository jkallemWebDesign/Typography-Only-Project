    <p><span>T</span>he best-known English pangram is "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog".[1] It has been used since at least the late 19th century[1] and was used by Western Union to test Telex/TWX data communication equipment for accuracy and reliability.[2] Pangrams like this are now used by a number of computer programs to display computer typefaces.</p>
    
    <h2>Short pangrams</h2>
